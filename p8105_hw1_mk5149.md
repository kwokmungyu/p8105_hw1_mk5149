The `early_january_weather` dataset contains 358 rows and 15 columns.  
Important variables include `origin`, `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`,
`temp`, `dewp`, `humid`, `wind_dir`, `wind_dir`, `wind_speed`,
`wind_gust`, `precip`, `pressure`, `visib` and `time_hour`.  
The mean temperature during this period was 39.5821229 degrees
Fahrenheit.

The scatterplot shows the relationship between time (x-axis) and
temperature (y-axis) in early January, with point color indicating
humidity. Temperatures generally increased over the course of the two
weeks, although fluctuations occurred within each day. Higher humidity
values (lighter blue points) appear more often during periods of higher
temperature, especially in the second week of January. Overall, the plot
suggests a warming trend accompanied by varying levels of humidity.
